We published 13047 images of 5389 people, 8588 eyes, which were taken between October 11, 2011 and September 6, 2018, 2011 at Tsukazaki Hospital, with Optos (200Tx), which was the main device of our development and research. Tsukazaki Hospital is the largest ophthalmology facility in Japan. Over 15 years, I have built a database from 1 million or more images of 100,000 or more IDs. In addition, we have made a variety of papers up until now based on the data taken in our daily practice. In fact, we are a top planner in AI development in the Japanese ophthalmology industry. It is hoped that publishing this data set will not only advance ophthalmology AI research but also help to educate ophthalmology and AI human resources. Why is the Optos images dataset? We place great importance on national health insurance system in Japan. This system, which can ensure the right to medical treatment for rich and poor people equally, is a very important system for medical treatment to function as an infrastructure in Japan. On the other hand, it is clear that as the declining birthrate and the aging population progress, the system will not stand. Therefore, there are only three methods left to address the declining birthrate and aging population: (1) increasing efficiency of medical practice by IT, (2) medical inbound (3) innovation in Japan in our opinion. We have published papers using ultra wide-field fundus images taken with the Optos of Nikon in Japan. This is very meaningful in terms of enhancing the presence of the Japanese company's product in the world. Our paper of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) diagnosis using Neural Network has been taken up by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. RRD is the 1st cause of litigation-related disease in Ophthalmology in the United States, and is a very important disease in developed countries. Lesions of RRD can only be taken with Optos.

If the tags of the AMD, RVO, Gla, MH, DR, RD, RP, AO, DM are 0, it means the eye don\u2019t have fundus disease (Normal eye).
